Verification and Important Note
Your code should now run correctly with the patch.

However, be aware that dependency analysis tools like pip check will likely
still show the incompatibility warning. This is because the version metadata of
the Git-installed package is still registered as 0.0.0.

You can safely ignore this warning in this specific case, as you have manually
ensured that the correct (patched) code is in place. The warning is cosmetic;
the functionality will work as intended.
